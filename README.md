<h3 align="center">CODELESS END-TO-END AUTOMATED TESTING</h3>

Puppetry is a powerful, no-code/low-code test automation tool for end-to-end (E2E) testing of web applications. Built on top of [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), it provides a user-friendly UI for creating, managing, and running automated browser testsâ€”without writing complex scripts. Designed for developers, QA engineers, and testers, Puppetry simplifies web automation while offering flexibility for advanced users.

# Welcome Puppetry
Puppetry offers you an easy-to-use UI where you choose browser methods and assertions from a predefined list, with predefined settings, guided by extensive tips.
Namely you can do the following:
- record user flow
- declare element targets as pairs `variable = locator`, where locator can be either CSS selector or Xpath.
- manage your test structure in BDD style (project, suite, test context, test case)
- manage page/element methods and assertions
- run the tests in Chromium/Chromium/Chrome/Firefox/Edge
- export the project as Jest/Puppeteer bundle ready to run in CLI (e.g. by a continuous integration server)
